# flutter-chatapp

Welcome to my Chat app built with flutter and Supabase!

## Live Demo 

Here you can find a live demo: https://georgebjork.github.io/flutter_chatapp/

If you want to try out this app, you will first have to create an account. After account creation, you will receive an email with a localhost link. Click that link to verify your account. This can take a minute to receive. After your account is verified, you can then click I already have an account and use your credentials to sign in. Then click the avatar at the top with GE and this will create a chat with me!
